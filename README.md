## Project Description
Forums are scraped in realtime and stored in Mongodb. Data cleansing operations are performed, and metrics for project polarity and subjectivity are obtained. Topic-wise, the project tracks conversations from their inception, and observes moving average trends through the forum lifecycle. Additional value will be provided in this project through the development of different meta-levels that can be tracked over time. Information is blinded, for proprietary reasons. Below you can see results from 8/18/2019 on subjectivity and polarity measures.
